## Workflows
### <a href="https://github.com/CobiontID/kmer_decomposition/tree/main/readviz_pipeline">Read k-mer decomposition and visualisation</a>

### Contig/scaffold k-mer decomposition and visualisation
Tallies k-mers in a read set, reduce to two dimensions and visualise read clusters (defaults to tetranucleotides). Annotates read plots with additional sequence features, such as estimated coding density, approximate k-mer coverage and sequence k-mer diversity.

#### Example data set: _Erannis defoliaria_
Decomposed read tetranucleotides from _Erannis defoliaria_ indicate the presence of bacteria in the sample (top). The reads are coloured by estimated coding density.

## Tools
### <a href="https://github.com/CobiontID/kmer_decomposition/tree/main/kmer-counter">kmer-counter</a>
Count the number of occurences of each k-mer of size k for each record in a fasta file of nucleotide sequences (canonicalised or non-canonicalised). Implemented in Rust, runs approximately ten times faster than the equivalent code in Python.
### <a href="https://github.com/CobiontID/kmer_decomposition/tree/main/unique-kmer-counts">unique-kmer-counter</a>
Count the number of distinct k-mers of size k for each record in a fasta files of nucleotide sequences, and divide by sequence length. Implemented in Rust.

#### vae.py
Read k-mer counts are reduced to two dimensions following the method of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114">Kingma and Welling (2013)</a>. Outputs two-dimensional representation of the read set and a basic plot.
#### vae_draw.py
Renders two-dimensional representations generated by vae.py with optional coloured annotation
#### labelling utils
- `category_labels.py` Assign sequences to bins based on whether they are contained in a set defined by a file (e.g. lists of sequences identified as belonging to a particular taxon)
- `category_labels_from_cont.py`Assign sequences to bins based on a continuous vector of numbers, either using quantiles (default) or linear slices (e.g. estimated coding density)
- `category_labels_from_cont_manual.py` Assign sequences to bins based on a list of boundaries (e.g. to slice k-mer coverage estimates at the minima of a histogram)
